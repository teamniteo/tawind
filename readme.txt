The WordPress theme built for Tailwind CSS.

A bare bones (6kb), block-based, full-site-editing, theme for building WordPress websites fast with Tailwind CSS.

### Lightweight
Clocking in at 6kb the Draft block-based theme is the perfect canvas for building your next Tailwind CSS powered WordPress site.

### UI-less
The Draft theme removes most of the block editor UI and moves it into Tailwind CSS utility classes.

### Far-from-blank
Start with a far-from-blank canvas by leveraging our expertly crafted, responsive, ready-to-use WordPress block patterns that work flawlessly with the FREE Draft theme.

### Full site editing (FSE)
The Draft theme was built from the ground-up to support modern WordPress, the block editor and full site editing.

## How it works

### Add template parts
The Draft theme doesn’t ship with any template-parts, instead either create them from scratch or copy and paste them from our block pattern library.

### Add templates
The Draft theme doesn’t ship with any templates either. Create them from scratch or copy and paste these from our block template library.

### Add utility classes
Finally, the Draft theme ships with almost no styles – all styles are driven by Tailwind CSS.
